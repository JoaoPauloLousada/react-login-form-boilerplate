# React Login Form Boilerplate
 
## This is a form login boilerplate for React projects.

### Here are the dependencies you need to install:
 - npm install formik --save
 - npm install yup --save

Since you have a React project initialized, all you have to do is install these dependencies and use the LoginForm component.
As it's a boilerplate, the component is not styled, this is totally up to you.
